# Optical Character Recognition and Translation from Sinhala to Tamil for Printed Documents

---

"The goal of this project is to develop a software application that can recognize printed text in Sinhala language, convert it to editable text, and then translate it to Tamil language. The application will utilize optical character recognition (OCR) technology to convert printed documents of Sinhala text into digital text, and then use machine translation algorithms to translate the Sinhala text into Tamil language.

The project will be implemented using the following steps:

- Data Collection: Collect a large dataset of printed Sinhala documents in different fonts and styles to train the OCR engine and the translation model.
- OCR Engine Development: Develop an OCR engine using deep learning techniques to recognize Sinhala characters from printed documents.
- Language Translation Model Development: Develop a machine translation model using neural machine translation techniques to translate Sinhala text to Tamil language.
- User Interface Development: Develop a user-friendly interface that allows users to upload scanned images of printed Sinhala documents and receive the translated Tamil text.
- Integration and Testing: Integrate the OCR engine and the translation module into the user interface and conduct thorough testing to ensure accuracy and performance."
